# Test both provisioning on an existing and fresh machine
# DEV: Provisioning on an existing machine catches edge cases like forgetting to delete files
env:
  - BOOTSTRAP_LAST_TAG=FALSE
  - BOOTSTRAP_LAST_TAG=TRUE

# DEV: Due to the nature of Travis CI, we must use the `exec` backend for testing
#   Additionally, since we need to execute some commands as root
#   and since Serverspec doesn't support `sudo` invocations with the `exec`
#   we need to install/invoke our test commands with `sudo`

  # If we want to provision the last tag, then provision it
